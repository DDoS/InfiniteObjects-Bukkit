variables:
  height: randomInt(32, 56)
  lowestLeafGroup: randomInt(16, 32)
  leafGroupCount: randomInt(1, 5)

lists:
  randomAngles: <leafGroupCount> randomFloat(0, 2 * PI)
  leafGroupsX: <leafGroupCount> sin(randomAngles) * randomInt(3, 7)
  leafGroupsY: <leafGroupCount> lowestLeafGroup += randomInt(4, 8)
  leafGroupsZ: <leafGroupCount> cos(randomAngles) * randomInt(3, 7)
  branchBaseY: <leafGroupCount> leafGroupsY - 4

shapes:
  trunk: Cuboid(2, height, 2)
  leaves: <leafGroupCount> Sphere(randomInt(2, 4), randomInt(2, 4), randomInt(2, 4))

pickers:
  leavesPicker: InnerOuterPicker(100, LEAVES.3, 50, LEAVES.3)

build:
  - place(trunk, LOG.3, 0, 0, 0)
  - place(leaves, leavesPicker, leafGroupsX, leafGroupsY, leafGroupsZ)
  - trace(0, branchBaseY, 0, leafGroupsX, leafGroupsY, leafGroupsZ, LOG.3)
